# need to manually change the checkpoint path
# remember to use the last_*.ckpt because mcd only trains for the last 10 epochs
# and the best.ckpt (according to accuracy) is typically not within the last 10 epochs
# therefore using best.ckpt is equivalent to early stopping with standard cross-entropy loss
